## Setup

Some preliminaries.

```{r setup}
#| output: false
library(R2jags)
library(openxlsx)
library(viridisLite)
source("code/helpers.R")
parms = c("Pl", "l", "amax.scale", "D", "gc.scale", "ca", "meso.scale",
          "Ci0_m", "A0_m", "d13Ca_m", "A", "D13C", "gcop")
```

Load data.

```{r data}
d = read.xlsx("data/stomata-franks_zhang_2024_P1.0.xlsx", sheet = 1, startRow = 3)
```

## PSM inversion

First prepare the data, then run the model inversion. We will do two different analyses. In the first, each sample (leaf) will be interpreted independently, and a set of CO~2~ (and all other PSM parameter) estimates obtained for that leaf. In the second case, we will use a hierarchical model with three levels:

![](cretaceous_files/images/structure.png)

```{r}
# Individual
data = parseFranks(d, FALSE)
post = jags.parallel(data, NULL, parms, "code/models/forwardFranksMulti.R", 
                     n.chains = 3, n.iter = 3e6, n.burnin = 1e6, n.thin = 1e3)

# Hierarchical
data = parseFranks(d)
post.cl = jags.parallel(data, inits, parms, "code/models/forwardFranksMulti.R", 
                        n.chains = 3, n.iter = 2e6, n.burnin = 1e4, n.thin = 1e3)

```

The results of the first (individual) analysis can be compared directly with the results of the 'traditional' application of the Franks model (as reported in Xiaoqing's paper and the CO~2~PIP data sheet). One would expect the results to be pretty similar, since we are using the same model structure and prior assumptions about parameter values in the PSM as were applied in the traditional analysis.

```{r}
plot(d$CO2_ppm[-(1:3)], post$BUGSoutput$median$ca, pch = 21, bg = "grey50",
     cex = 2, lwd = 2, ylab = "Median ca from PSM", 
     xlab = "Median ca traditional")
abline(0, 1, lwd = 2)
points(d$CO2_ppm[-(1:3)], post$BUGSoutput$median$ca, pch = 21, bg = "grey50",
       cex = 2, lwd = 2)

```

It's maybe more interesting to look at the results of the hierarchical model, which correspond more closely to how we would apply the PSM in practice. Here, the model structure provides a mechanistically-based framework for aggregating information from multiple samples, eliminating the need to subjective post-hoc aggregation of results from multiple leaves. Given that the model structure is different, we wouldn't necessarily expect identical results from the traditional and PSM-based analyses.

```{r}

library(viridisLite)
cols = viridis(3)

## Plot showing sample and level distributions
dens = apply(post$BUGSoutput$sims.list$ca, 2, density)
dens.cl = apply(post.cl$BUGSoutput$sims.list$ca, 2, density)

ymax = 0
for(i in seq_along(dens.cl)){
  ymax = max(ymax, dens.cl[[i]]$y)
}
for(i in seq_along(dens)){
  ymax = max(ymax, dens[[i]]$y)
}

plot(0, 0, type = "n", xlim = c(100, 8000), ylim = c(0, ymax), 
     xlab = "ca", ylab = "Density")
for(i in seq_along(dens)){
  lines(dens[[i]], col = cols[data$level[i]])
}

for(i in seq_along(dens.cl)){
  lines(dens.cl[[i]], col = cols[i], lwd = 4)
}

ypos = par("usr")[3] + c(0.85, 0.9, 0.95) * diff(range(par("usr")[3:4]))
arrows(d$CO2_ppm[1:3] - d$CO2_uncertainty_neg_ppm[1:3], ypos, d$CO2_ppm[1:3], 
       angle = 90, code = 2, col = cols, lwd = 3, length = 0.05)
arrows(d$CO2_ppm[1:3] + d$CO2_uncertainty_pos_ppm[1:3], ypos, d$CO2_ppm[1:3], 
       col = cols, lwd = 3, length = 0)

legend("topright", legend = c(261, 292, 417), col = cols, lwd = 3, bty = "n",
       title = "Level")

```

Here the individual-level PSM interpretations are shown in the thin lines and the think-lined density kernels are the PSM-based estimates for the three stratigraphic levels. The reported estimates derived from aggregating the individual-level traditional interpretations are shown at the top for reference (median and 95% confidence interval). Here we do see some differences:

* PSM-based estimates for the stratigraphic levels are somewhat better constrained.
* Essentially no difference between the posterior `ca` distributions for the three stratigraphic levels, whereas the traditional estimates suggest a slight increase up-section (but well within uncertainty).

Comparing the PSM interpretations for the individuals and levels, you can see that the hierarchical model interpretations *are not* simple averages over the individual sample distributions. Take the lowest stratigraphic level (261), for example...there are many more individual samples with posterior `ca` distributions centered below the hierarchical model distribution for the stratigraphic level. But there are also several samples from that level which yield among the highest individual `ca` estimates. In the hierarchical model, a single CO~2~ value is sought that is most likely given *all* of the sample data from that stratigraphic level. The somewhat higher posterior distribution for level 261 (compared with the traditional method) reflects the a balance across all of the data, also accounting for the fact that individuals of the same species share a number of common parameters that constrain the variation in their response to different CO~2~ conditions.
